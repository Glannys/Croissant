    <h1>Croissant</h1>

    <p>
      Croissants, those crescent-shaped agents of chaos, are like the ninjas of
      the bakery world. They lure you in with their golden, buttery allure,
      promising a simple breakfast experience. But beware! With each bite, a
      flaky storm ensues, turning your neat morning routine into a
      'crumb'-tastrophe. You end up wearing more croissant than you eat, looking
      as if you've been in a light-hearted tussle with a pastry pillow. Despite
      the aftermath, every crumbly encounter leaves you smiling, secretly
      planning your next flaky mission.
